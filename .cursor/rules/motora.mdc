1. this is a docker project, always check the package.json don't use npm install
2. this is a Create React App project, not a Vite project

Naming Conventions:
- Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `onClick`, `handleSubmit`).
- Use PascalCase for component names in react and react native (e.g., `UserProfile`, `ChatScreen`).
- Directory names should be lowercase and hyphenated (e.g., `user-profile`, `chat-screen`).
- Avoid using ambiguous names for variables or components 

UI and Styling:
- Use consistent styling, either through `StyleSheet.create()` or Styled Components.
- Ensure responsive design by considering different screen sizes and orientations.
- Do not use inline styling. Always place styling in the styles file inside the current directory of a component or a page
