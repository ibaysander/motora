# Modularized React App Structure

This application has been refactored for better maintainability, following a modular approach with clean separation of concerns.

## Directory Structure

The application follows this modular structure:

```
src/
├── components/           # Reusable UI components
│   ├── layout/           # Layout components (Sidebar, etc.)
│   └── ui/               # UI components (Notification, etc.)
├── features/             # Feature-specific code
│   ├── products/         # Product-related components, hooks, and types
│   ├── categories/       # Category-related components and types
│   └── brands/           # Brand-related components and types
├── hooks/                # Custom React hooks
│   ├── useApi.ts         # Hook for API operations
│   └── useLocalStorage.ts # Hook for localStorage management
├── utils/                # Utility functions
│   ├── dataUtils.ts      # Data manipulation utilities (sorting, pagination)
│   └── storageUtils.ts   # LocalStorage utilities
└── App.tsx               # Main application component (modularized)
```

## Key Components

1. **App Component**: The main component has been refactored to be more modular, separating concerns into appropriate hooks and components.

2. **Layout Components**: 
   - `Sidebar`: Navigation sidebar
   - `SidebarToggle`: Toggle for expanding/collapsing the sidebar

3. **UI Components**:
   - `Notification`: Reusable notification system

4. **Custom Hooks**:
   - `useApi`: Centralizes all API operations
   - `useLocalStorage`: Manages localStorage with proper typing

5. **Utilities**:
   - Data manipulation (sorting, filtering, pagination)
   - LocalStorage management

## Improvements

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component, hook, and utility has a specific responsibility
- **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript usage throughout
- **Reusability**: Components are now more reusable
- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to maintain
- **State Management**: Better organization of state using custom hooks
- **Code Organization**: Logical grouping of related code

## Implementation Details

The original monolithic `App.tsx` (1971 lines) has been broken down into:

1. **Layout Components**: Sidebar and SidebarToggle extracted as separate components
2. **API Layer**: API calls are managed through the useApi hook
3. **LocalStorage**: A useLocalStorage hook manages persistence
4. **Utilities**: Helper functions for data manipulation moved to utils
5. **UI Components**: Notification component extracted

This modularization follows the adjusted guidelines in motora.mdc, which emphasizes modular, maintainable React code with proper TypeScript usage.
